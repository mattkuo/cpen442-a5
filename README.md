1. Post a message (one message per group) in the course piazza indicating which malware your group has picked.

2. If another group posted an earlier message indicating that they had picked the same malware as your group, go back to step 1 and pick "free" malware.

3. Analyze the design of the picked malware, i.e., its structure, behavior, mechanisms it uses for selecting victims, infecting them, hiding itself and its authors, etc.

4. Identify the aspects specific to your malware that can be used to detect or prevent it. Based on your analysis, recommend short, medium and log term countermeasures (i.e., protection and detection techniques) against the threat posed by this malware. Classify your techniques using material from the corresponding course session.

5. Identify which of the principles for designing secure systems have not been followed by the developers of those systems vulnerabilities in which allowed the malware you analyzed to become effective.

6. Cite all your sources of information.

7. Use no more than 4 pages to write a short report documenting your findings obtained in steps 3--5. Use figures and tables, if necessary to achieve better impact of your report.

8. Your report should be submitted as one file in format of [IEEE Transactions](http://www.ieee.org/web/publications/authors/transjnl/) with proper title, authors, abstract, introduction, body, conclusion, and references sections.

9. Post your report in PDF on piazza by the same deadline as the one for this assignment. Marks for late reports will be decreased, 1% of the problem mark per each minute after the deadline.
